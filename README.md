Make it Rain
============

A collection of thin, extensible and pretty `Makefile`s for simple C/C++ projects.

If you find standards Makefile too complex or cumbersome, try `makerain`, since many
hard-edges were softened and it's still GNU Makefiles.

## Features

*  Pretty and sane interface.
*  Compatible with many compilers ( gcc, clang, vscode )
*  Cross-platform ( LINUX, WINDOWS, MAC)
*  Compatible with standard `CFLAGS` & `LDFLAGS`
*  Built-in support for `doctests`

## Installation

1. Copy the folder `makerain` to your project.
2. Create a `Makefile` in the project root.
3. Configure it to your taste:

```Makefile
SHELL:=/bin/bash

VERSION :=  "0.0.1"
NAME    :=  hello
TARGET  :=  Release

# Output
OUTPUT_EXE 	  := build/${NAME}

# Dependencies, assets and binary all bundled together for simple
# deployment (eg: Mac .app , flatpack, zip folder...)
OUTPUT_BUNDLE := dist/${NAME}

# Copy Assets to bundle
ASSET_FOLDER 	:= $(NAME).res

# External dependencies, like curl or openssl
# May have both shared lib (.so) and header files
DLL_FOLDER := dep

# Include folders
INCLUDES 	= include/ ext/  						# bultin and 3¬∫ party
LIBS 		= m dl pthread curl jansson 			# libm, dlopen, libpthread, libcurl

# Our code & 3party
SOURCES 		= $(wildcard src/*.cpp src/*/*.cpp ext/*/*.c) 

# Entry point
MAIN_APP	= src/main.cpp
TEST_APP 	= src/testsRunner.cpp

# Include build rules
include ./makerain/Makefile
``` 

## Usage

| Description      | command      	            | 
|--------------	   | --------------	            |
| make             | Compile all files         	|
| make dll         | Compile external dependencies | 
| make info        | Display build information 	|
| make run         | Run generated executable   |
| make debug       | Run with debugger attached |
| make doctest     | Compile `doctest`          | 
| make test        | Runs `doctest` 	        | 


## HOW TO: Overwrite config options ?

Use the traditional behaviour of overwriting variables in the SHELL. For example:

#### Use clang as compiler
> CXX=clang CX=clang make

#### Compiling with DEBUG symbols
> TARGET=DEBUG make

## Examples

A barebones App with dynamic library support is included in the directory `examples`.
